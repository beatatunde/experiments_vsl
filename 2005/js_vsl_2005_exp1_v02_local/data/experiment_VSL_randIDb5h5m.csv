One of our main questions is what kind of representations we can create about our visual environment and how these representations influence our behavior. At our lab we use multiple methods, for example behavioral experiments and computational models. In this experiment you will observe scenes consisting of abstract shapes and answer simple questions about them. <br><br>At the beginning and throughout the experiment you will receive precise information about what to do. The experiment takes about 20 minutes in total. <br><br>The test is voluntary, and you can withdraw your participation at any time. We treat your personal information confidentially. <br>Only those people who work on this research project have access to your data. We will work with group level statistics. We will only report the results of the group in scientific publications and conferences. This research was approved by the Hungarian Psychological Research Ethics Committee.<br><br>If you have any further questions about the study, you can contact the experimenter, Dominik Garber, PhD Student.
