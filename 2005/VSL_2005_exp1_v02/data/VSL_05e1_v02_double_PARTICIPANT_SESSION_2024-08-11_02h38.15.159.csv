One of our main questions is what kind of representations we can create about our visual environment and how these representations influence our behavior. At our lab we use multiple methods, for example behavioral experiments and computational models. In this experiment you will observe scenes consisting of abstract shapes and answer simple questions about them. <br><br>At the beginning and throughout the experiment you will receive precise information about what to do. The experiment takes about 25 minutes in total. <br><br>The test is voluntary, and you can withdraw your participation at any time. We treat your personal information confidentially. <br>Only those people who work on this research project have access to your data. We will work with group level statistics. We will only report the results of the group in scientific publications and conferences. This research was approved by the Hungarian Psychological Research Ethics Committee.<br><br>If you have any further questions about the study, you can contact the experimenter, Beata Tunde Szabo, PhD Student. Contact: 1051 Nador u. 11.

You will see a checkerboard with random simple shapes appearing in different positions in the checkerboard. Your task is simply to observe the patterns so that you would be able to answer some questions about the sequence after the practice session.  The session will last for about 13 minutes.  Please, pay attention to EACH display! <br><br>Occasionally, there will be an attention check asking you to press the spacebar. ","0"
